    <p>This little sketch was produced in p5.js to experiment with use of SIN to produce smooth waves and rotational movement.</p>
    <p>I got it all working, but was having trouble getting the smoke to move correctly. Rotating the boat meant using Processing's rotate() function, which transforms the entire coordinate system.<p>
      <p>I don't like this method. The smoke wasn't moving naturally because its position was being altered by the rotate function after it had been placed on screen. It was locked into the coordinate system of the boat, which was changing.</p>
    <p>I asked AI (ChatGPT) to assist with making it work, and it made a right mess. It was suggesting commands which don't exist in Processing, and its solutions didn't work.</p>
    <p>Eventually I gave it over to Gemini and it was able to suggest a fix. </p></div>
